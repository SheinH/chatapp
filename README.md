#Chat App

This is a ncurses based chat app that I banged out on my keyboard in an hour and a half. I made this mostly so I can chat with people while I am teamviewering them. Currently, it is hard coded to support two users named Shein and Victoria.

##How to use:

Simply type messaages and hit enter to log them on the screen
If you want to switch users, hit tab.
To quit, enter "quit" in the message field and hit enter.
